# SLSC-EDS-Plugin-Custom-Device

SLSC EDS (Electronic Datasheet) Plugin Custom Device allows any generic SLSC Capabilities File to be used within VeriStand.

## LabVIEW Version

LabVIEW 2017


## Developer Documentation

### Design Decisions
- always use NVMEMcap.bin file and custom parser to extract all information from module. This reduces effort for maintaining the option of importing automatically from a connected module as well as an offline configuration.
- Not showing string properties since it is unknown how they would be used in VeriStand.
